    This example adapted from the beautiful starfield example shared in Pygame4000

    pg.examples.stars

    We are all in the gutter,
    but some of us are looking at the stars.
                                            -- Oscar Wilde

A simple starfield example. Note you can move the 'center' of
the starfield by leftclicking in the window. This example show
the basics of creating a window, simple pixel plotting, and input
event management.
